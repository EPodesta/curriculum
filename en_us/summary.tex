    I am a geek who loves Vim, Linux and enjoys to customize all of the
    development enviroment. I have 5+ years experience on parallel and
    distributed systems focusing on back-end. With my experience, I learned to
    tackle several tasks to improve problem-solving skills, and increase my
    knowledge about tools and technologies. In each of those years, I developed
    and increased my love for challenging tasks and the knowledge that comes
    with every task solved.
